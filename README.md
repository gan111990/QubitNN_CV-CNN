# QubitNN_CV-CNN
#This is the code developed during my master research at NSU. Qubit Inspired Neural Network(QubitNN) architecture is originally purposed by N. Kouda and his colleague researchers. You can find paper in attachments. My research was mainly focused around discovering applicability of QubitNN in computer vision(CV) classification tasks. Convolution also plays a very important role in todays CV classification tasks and increase accuracy significantly, so we tried Complex-valued Convolution Neural Network(CV-CNN).
